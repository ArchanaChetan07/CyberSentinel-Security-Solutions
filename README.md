# CyberSentinel Security Solutions - Anomaly Detection System

## Company Overview  
**Company Name:** CyberSentinel Security Solutions  
**Industry:** Cyber Security / Tech  
**Company Size:** Small (100 Employees)  

## Abstract  
CyberSentinel Security Solutions specializes in identifying cyber threats, including unauthorized access and DDoS attacks. The company aims to leverage machine learning-based anomaly detection to identify network intrusions and potential cybersecurity threats for its clients.

## Problem Statement  
With the rise in sophisticated cyber-attacks, CyberSentinel Security Solutions clients have been experiencing frequent security incidents, including unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, and insider threats. Given the company's history of providing cybersecurity solutions for enterprises and government agencies, it is critical to create a robust anomaly detection system for customers.  

Traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems fail to keep up with evolving attack patterns, leading to delayed threat response and increased financial loss.  

### **Project Goal**  
Analyze network traffic data using advanced anomaly detection techniques to detect and mitigate security threats in real time.

## Goals  
 Create an anomaly detection system for real-time threat detection.  
 Identify unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate cyber-attacks.  
 Reduce false positive rates in existing security monitoring solutions.  
 Improve incident response time by providing actionable alerts.  
 Utilize machine learning models that scale efficiently with large datasets.  

## Non-Goals  
 Developing a fully automated security system without human intervention.  
 Preventing all types of cyber threats (focus is on anomaly detection).  
 Addressing compliance and regulatory requirements in-depth (handled separately by legal teams).  

## Data Sources  
The project leverages publicly available network security datasets:  
- [UNSW-NB15 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15/data)  
- [CIC-DDoS2019 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aymenabb/ddos-evaluation-dataset-cic-ddos2019)  
- [DDoS Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devendra416/ddos-datasets)
